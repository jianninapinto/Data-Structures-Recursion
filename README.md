# Data Structures and Recursion

This GitHub repository provides implementations of basic data structures such as stacks, queues, and linked lists, along with recursive solutions to some problems.

## Exercise 1: Implementing a Stack using Python's deque module
The implementation of a stack using Python's deque module provides a way to efficiently add and remove elements from the top of the stack. The code in this repository demonstrates how to create a stack using a deque and provides methods to push and pop elements from the stack.

## Exercise 2: Implementing a Queue using Python's deque module
The implementation of a queue using Python's deque module provides a way to efficiently add and remove elements from the front and rear of the queue. The code in this repository demonstrates how to create a queue using a deque and provides methods to enqueue and dequeue elements from the queue.

## Exercise 3: Converting a Non-Recursive Solution to a Recursive Alternative
This exercise goal is to convert a Python implementation of a linked list search function from an iterative solution using a while loop to a recursive solution that uses function calls.
